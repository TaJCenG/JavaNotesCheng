	/*What is java and features ?
	 * A programming language created by sun micro system and it was spelled as OAk before public release
	 * All the instructions in one place is called as program and it is MLL
	 * Features :: simple OOP Portable PlatformIndependent Secured Robust Performance Threads
	 * 
	 * Why it is Platform independent?
	 * Platform :- combination of both processor + operating system
	 *  java compiler convert into byte code, JVM is all into binary
	 *  WORA write once run anywhere
	 *  we can use the byte code and can use any system
	 *  
	 *  Interpreter : convert the code into MLL line by line
	 *  
	 *  Compiler : it takes HLL input and convert to MLL
	 *             a software which convert HLL to MLL
	 *             
	 *  Source : whatever we have coded and saved like(sysout, class), once it is saved it compiled to byte is known as class
	 *  
	 *  CLass : which consists of java compiled code or bytes code
	 *          Design or prototype from which objects are created
	 *          class has variables and methods
	 *          methods have brackets()
	 *          
	 *  Object : Instance of class
	 *  
	 *  in JDK we have JRe(lib) -> JVM
	 *

/*Detailed explanation about class and object
 * 
 *  class is :: person ( BLUEPRINT)
 *  Compiler :: manager :: will talk i want table which suit my gaming chair  so this manager change the details into technical terms
 *  JVM(Carpenter) :: Object(Table) Technical person width heigh material whichtype of table 
 *  
 *  ***This blue print gets converted into bytecode and this bytecode goes into JVM it will give object***
 *  1. i went to the carpenter and ask him i want table
 *  2. he said which type of table u want ( height W Material)
 *  3. I didnt get him so i ask manager i want table which suits m gaming chair
 *  4. The manager(Compiler) changed my details into technical terms
