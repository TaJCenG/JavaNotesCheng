	 * POLYMORPHISM :- performing a single task in different ways & A single interface having multiple implementations is also
	 *                 Achieved in two ways  overloading  | overriding
	 * 
	 *   1 : M  or many forms
	 *   Human -> friends, teacher, dad, mom -> one-many
	 * 
	 * compile time polymorphism  /early binding  => method overloading
	 * Run time polymorphism    => method overriding
	 * 
	 * OVERLOADING :- creating multiple methods with same name but different paramaters
	 * 
	 * STATIC METHOD will not override in java it is then it is treating as new method
	 * It will get inherited cannot override
	 * By chance we are writing the same method once again if it is the case of static then we have to conclude that i'm not overriding
	 * behind the scenes the jvm & compiler treats as specialized method.
	 * 
	 * Advantages of polymorphism :- Reduced size of code & flexible
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Created 3 simple program with polymorphis concept 
	 * 
	 * ONE - ONE Association 
	 * HAS - A 
	 * A relationship b/w 2 entities where one entity of one class is mapped to one or more entity of another class
	 * Account.java
	 * Employee.java
	 * Testing.java
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * ONE - ONE Association constructor injection 
	 * AccountOne
	 * EmployeeOne
	 * TestingOne
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * ONE - MANY Association constructor injection
	 * A relationship b/w 2 entities where one entity of one class is mapped to multiple entities of another class
